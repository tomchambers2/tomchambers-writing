    	<p>In the <a href="/2015/10/23/Improving-my-social-life/">last post</a> I described the means by which I’m going to improve my social life. You can’t change what you don’t measure. So I need some metrics. Here’s a graph (made with <a href="http://d3js.org" target="_blank" rel="external">d3</a>) of my current social network. You can click and drag the nodes to ping them about.</p>
<iframe src="http://tomchambers2.github.io/social-graph/social-graph.html" width="500" height="500" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>I graded every connection between me and my connections and between my connections from 0-5 and the nodes on the graph arrange themselves with respect to the strength of their connection with other nodes.</p>
<p>0 - have never met<br>1 - have met, but wouldn’t approach in supermarket<br>2 - have met, would say hello in the street, but not chat in supermarket<br>3 - would stop to chat for 5 minutes with person in the supermarket, see at events, no active contact<br>4 - actively go out together every so often, don’t call to chat<br>5 - comfortable calling, speak weekly, go out regularly</p>
<p>There are some caveats. Originally I’d planned to make various ones for people I’d known over the years, but it turned out to be too hard to remember that far back. The relationships below 3/‘would stop for a 5 minute chat’ are too numerous and nebulous to recall precisely and the effect of adding them makes the labour of determining the connections immense (n^2 - n). At that point whether I do or don’t ‘know’ someone gets too fuzzy to calculate.</p>
<p>I excluded professional contacts, simply because it screwed with the rating. There are some people I talk to a lot but are not high contacts, because it’s all work related.</p>
<p>The graph isn’t that accurate. I spent quite a while trying to configure it so that it would all be precise, but it doesn’t really work like that because the resulting graph is a simulation of forces which depends on the randomised starting points of the nodes. Dave for instance should be closer to me, but because of his strong ties to his subgroup he ends up quite far away. So this kind of visualisation might actually reveal unconsidered impacts of the strengths of relationships.</p>
<p>So this is one useful visualisation of how my life will change over the next 3 months. Of course there are lots more interesting things I’d like to understand. For example, where and what kind of events help me meet new people? What behaviours, like alcohol consumption, lead to a change in the number of new people met and relationships developed? How do initial contacts pan out over time? Do some sources of meeting people lead to more friendships than others? On the micro level, I’d like to understand how well the personalities of myself and others lead to rapport when meeting for the first time.</p>
<p>Here’s a full list of the data I’ll be capturing. In about 3 months I’ll be using this data to make a whole bunch of visualisations and see what insight I can divine into what I can do to grow my network and make more friends, and increase the quality of my social life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Social network (evaluated monthly)<ul>
<li>Number of connections at rank 4 and 5</li>
<li>Number of new nodes added to network as a whole</li>
<li>Density of network (number of friends that have mutual friends with me)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social activity (records kept in calendar)<ul>
<li>Events attended (invited to/instigated) (location, start time, end time)</li>
<li>Records of people met (location, time, source, meeting #)</li>
<li>Analysis of call logs, text messages and emails (frequency, time, distribution)</li>
<li>Alcohol consumption (units per day)</li>
<li>Time spent in different locations (recorded by Moves)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Romantic activity (evaluated monthly)<ul>
<li>Number of people asked on dates</li>
<li>Number of dates (separated by stage) + success metrics like reply rate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social skills (recorded on rolling basis, evaluate at non specific intervals)<ul>
<li>Qualitative analysis of my own and other’s social behaviour on first meeting - answering the question “what makes for a good conversation between new people?”</li>
<li>Qualitative analysis of actions and events in new relationships as they develop - answering the question “how and why does a first meeting evolve into a friendship?”</li>
<li>? - perhaps survey data collected from old and new friends on social abilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    	<p>To the frequent dismay of my friends and family, I tend to approach tasks with a moderately unhealthy single mindedness and have an obsessive focus on planning and analysis. I’ve decided to turn this focus to my social life and I’ll thus spend the next 2-3 months improving my social skills, expanding my network and tracking the results.</p>
<p>My social life has changed over the past few years. When I was at university, it was a lot more free flowing. I was in a place with a lot of people doing the same thing and with a lot of free time on their hands. I’m not a part of that community anymore, and my social life has declined in proportion. It’s also become more homogenous, as I’ve stopped having the spontaneous encounters with the people I’m not immediately comfortable with.</p>
<p>Something else that’s changed is that the people I used to know in my network were edge nodes that connected me to another network, essentially doing the work of maintaining that network for me, meaning I could go along to the parties and social events of that network without really being a part of it. Of course having this single link means low resiliency, so when my relationship declines with that individual node my connection to that network effectively ceases as well.</p>
<p>So now I’d like to actively change this. I want to live a more socially interesting life, to have a larger network and to make that network denser (each person-node has many connections to other nodes) for greater resiliency. I’d also like to meet more women. To do this I’m going to totally fill my free time with social activity and its analysis. I’m going to take every opportunity I can and create as many as possible. I’ll make an effort to meet new people and work out what parameters help me to develop rapport and what leads to the growth of a friendship.</p>
<p>Here’s a more complete list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know more people<ul>
<li>Make an effort to increase the rank of existing of contacts in network, including old friends who have slipped<ul>
<li>Send texts and emails to these people</li>
<li>Invite these people to events I’m going to and to meet individually</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make an effort to turn new acquaintances into increasingly ranked contacts in network<ul>
<li>Take notes on interactions with new people and work out what’s blocking progression, make effort to be actively social when meeting new people</li>
<li>Send texts and emails to these people</li>
<li>Invite these people to events I’m going to and to meet individually</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Invite friends to events where they can get to know each other to increase connectedness of network and establish core</li>
<li>Setup social media accounts<ul>
<li>Setup facebook + add friends</li>
<li>Setup twitter</li>
<li>Hire a freelancer to manage my facebook and twitter accounts - post updates and send digests of relevant information</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go out more<ul>
<li>Accept all invitations to social events from people I already know</li>
<li>Instigate events and invite people to attend, esp people I don’t know well</li>
<li>Find and attend meetup and similar events where interesting people might be</li>
<li>Start drinking<ul>
<li>Establish set of rules to prevent excessive drinking</li>
<li>Plan party to celebrate first beer, prepare flyer and guest list</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go on more dates<ul>
<li>Meet women in person (through knowing more people), ask them on dates</li>
<li>Set up profiles + send messages on online dating services<ul>
<li>Take photos for profile</li>
<li>OkCupid<ul>
<li>Set up bot for auto liking/profile viewing etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tinder<ul>
<li>Set up bot to auto like users, make date requests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Happn</li>
<li>Others (there seem to be hundreds)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    	<h2 id="PART_1">PART 1</h2><p>I’m setting out on a journey to create a noise that nobody’s ever heard before. Recently I was wandering down Kingsland Road at night and I heard a strange sound as I passed by a building site. I don’t remember what it was, mostly because I didn’t have any context to associate it with, but it was such an oddity that it knocked me out of my thoughts and set my mind down a new path, my senses attuned to new things everywhere, thinking ever so slightly differently.</p>
<p>So that got me trying to compose the same situation for others. I want to create a moment of strangeness for a stranger in the same place as me. A brief moment of unique sound, unrepeated and short enough that they question what they heard. Did they hear it at all? A trick of the mind? Was it something else? What did it mean? Ultimately they determine it’s something without meaning, something novel. They continue on with their senses expanded.</p>
<p>I’m writing this now, before having made anything to get a clear picture of what I set out to do. I find that when working on projects it’s very easy to lose track of what I’m actually trying to do and I end up being set on just getting things done and doing something ‘successfully’, rather than fulfilling the richness of the original ambition. Often success is orthogonal to the real value of what I’m creating. Sometimes an original failure is worth more than successfully popping something out of a mould.</p>
<p>I feel that it’s essential to capture the excitement of the concept itself, while it’s still grand and untamed by the constraints of reality. I need that when I’m looking at a bunch of wires and bits of wood and trying to remember why I thought this was going to be fun and interesting in the first place.</p>
<p>So my first thought is to get a basic understanding of sound’s parameters so I can look at everyday sounds and then tweak each one so that my sound becomes entirely unique. My first port of call was my colleague Frank, a former audio engineer who filled me in on auditory variables beyond frequency like wave shape and phase.</p>
<h2 id="PART_2">PART 2</h2><p>I spent some time consciously paying attention to all the sounds around me in a standard urban environment. Walking down the street, on the bus, in my office, sitting at home. There are lots of noisy noises. Windy, rustling, rumbling imprecise sounds. Then noises that stand out because they are high pitched and have recognisable tones in them. An oyster card beep, a piece of music, a bird’s call. And then the most distinguishable third category seems to be the human voice. It’s hard to say what makes it distinct, but it definitely is even when the content is inaudible. It has a kind of undulating quality, containing lots of different tones.</p>
<p>Playing with synths didn’t get me too far. I spent some time learning about synthesisers, how to manipulate them and produce different sounds. I never managed to create something that was wildly different from a synthy sound. It still sounds recognisably like someone bashing a keyboard even when only heard for a moment. Making noisy sounds is easy, but rather pointless as these just fade into the background of buses, cars and wind. The synthetic simpler tones are too easy to dismiss as the response of a computer.</p>
<p>In the course of my research I stumbled across some recordings of unusual noises supposedly heard around the world. These <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1IIUcNI0cw" target="_blank" rel="external">sky trumpets</a> are enough to make people stop and stare in unison trying to make sense of it all.</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-1IIUcNI0cw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Sadly I don’t think I can make a noise this loud. What makes it interesting is the lack of context. And at a normal volume it’s just another example of another noisy noise.</p>
<p>I was discussing this problem with my friend Michael and I asked him how he would go about trying to create a sound that no-one had ever heard before. He suggested that instead of trying to synthesise the sounds, I could just make them with my mouth. It actually works pretty well.</p>
<p>So what I ended up doing is recording my voice making strange sounds and then putting those through Garageband to create complex sounds that I could then tweak to be just outside the range of what seems human.</p>
<p>I spent some time wondering what the cheapest arduino setup I could use so I wouldn’t be too much out of pocket if someone pinched it. It turns out however that you can get an iPod shuffle knockoff, a speaker, battery and electronics project case for about £15. So I went with that and loaded the tracks onto the mp3 player with an hour of silence inbetween each noise.</p>
<h2 id="PART_3">PART 3</h2><p>Of course, the hardest part of this project is actually going out and putting it somewhere. That’s the extroverted part of this project and the whole reason why it’s exciting to me - having people interact with it. Programming is easy. I can do it any time of day or night. All the tools are readily available without delay. There’s never any social risk whatsoever. Actually going out and testing things is hard, there’s a risk of rejection and public failure.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, I wasn’t sure how to document this project. It’s part of my methodology to start small and experiment and learn. To do that I need to understand what the impact is. Of course, to do that here I’d have to hide in the undergrowth with a video camera, and then draw an inference from whatever small reaction someone had to the sound. Here’s a little demo of the intended experience:</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bEyqRZKUA-Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>So in this case I had to be a little unscientific. I ended up leaving it in Peckham Rye park for a week (the limits of the USB battery packs I used) tied to a tree in a spot where it couldn’t be seen but there are a fair bunch of people milling about most of the time. Then at the end of the week I went and cut it down again. I have no idea how well it worked, or indeed if anyone even heard it at all. It’s difficult making art like that.</p>

    	<p>I created some costumes for a party. I’m interested in the identities we portray with our clothing, our hair, our voices and body language. In particular the way these things can either make us feel more comfortable or inhibit us in social situations.</p>
<p><img src="/images/silver-burkas/silver-costumes-examples.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I once worked as an extra for a period film set in the 1940s. As I sat in the waiting room I looked around for someone interesting I talk to. It was a real challenge. Everyone had had their hair cut and make up done and was wearing their assigned costume. Until I actually went and talked to someone it was impossible to assign any characteristics to them. It was much more anonymising than say a fancy dress party, because the people involved had no choice in their costume. Basically, I didn’t know who was a cunt and who wasn’t. Every trace of personality had been washed away.</p>
<p>I considered that to be at a party without identity might be freeing. So my costumes were basically a big silver sheet designed to hide form (made from reflective silver fabric with an orange tulle section as a visor). Also part of the costume was a voice changing box to mask what the wearer sounded like. This was a cheap kids’ toy off ebay gaffer taped to a coat hanger as a frame.</p>
<p>My dinner party guests didn’t know what hit them. I invited two friends who didn’t know each other for a casual dining experience at my house. Upon arrival and before meeting each other I had them put on the full costume. I then introduced them. This is what followed.</p>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EM3L-Y9f-lM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>It wasn’t quite as successful as I’d hoped. The biggest problem with the outfits was physical. The fabric got hot really quickly. It made me quite pleased that I didn’t use my original choice of mylar, the stuff they wrap athletes in when they finish a race. The voice box kind of worked, but you could still hear the original  voice underneath. The outfits themselves were also quite bulky and made it difficult to move in. It made the game of monochromatic twister (shades of grey, in keeping with the theme of anonymity) somewhat difficult to play.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, once they took their costumes off they got along quite well. I asked a few leading questions to get them to say how freeing the experience was on camera, but mostly they just complained about the heat.</p>
<p>The result of the experiment: inconclusive. These costumes are no good though. The idea of stripping away facets of identity to become more free from social constraints still has some potential I think. If I repeat this I’ll give it a crack with some costumes that are a bit more fun to wear, or perhaps another method of anonymisation - making different things look the same is as good as concealing the identity of each.</p>
